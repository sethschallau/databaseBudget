# databaseBudget
Program for Budgeting:

Goal: The program will track income, spending, and provide percentages based on savings using this data.

Technologies: Python, MariaDB

How:

Create multiple users. These will be different databases. Create new user will create new database table, deleting will delete the database. Each user will specify what the income is when entering and its saving level. Changing will prompt to update their saving settings for a new income type 
Users must set their savings for each paycheck before entering, this will be stored in a table about the user.

User tables will tie their income tables. 

User -> data/info -> money -> spending | saving (basically different accounts)
