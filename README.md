# databaseBudget
Author: Seth Schallau
Technologies: Python, MariaDB

About the Project:
This project was undertaken due to two reasons. I needed to keep track of how much I am making, spending, and saving over the summer as I intern in the RTP area. I also decided that I need to take some initiative and develop a larger program utilizing modular programming principles. 

Reflection:
This, unfortunately, isn't as impressive as I thought it might be. There are obviously places where I could have made this even more modular, and I probably could have written this with better formatting/syntax. I'm not entirely satisfied, and if I have time with my school schedule I'd like to add some "quality of life" features to make this "program" more convenient to use. Including an "installer" that sets up a database would be nice too. Also, having the mysql user and password hard coded is a BIG no no and will eventually be changed whenever I can find time for an installer.

Possible Additions:
An installer. Graphical Display. Web or Mobile interface or port. Either a local copy (idk the feasability of this) or to send commands back to my laptop or other server. An installer is most likely the first that can be accomplished.


Requirements:
If anyone wanted to try this for some reason you would require a few pieces in place first:
	MariaDB installed on your system
	A user with the name and password hardcoded into the script (this should be changed eventualy)
	Python 2.7 because I found the best support for what I needed on that version.
