# databaseBudget
Program for Budgeting:

Goal: The program will track income, spending, and provide percentages based on savings using this data.

Technologies: Python, MariaDB

How:

Install and setup mariaDB on the local system (not done, not in progress)
Create the database for the project (done)
Create tables to store this data: Savings, Spending, People, Categories, Total. These categories will be used to determine who and what money is being spent on. (done)
Enter enter income and how much will be saved (nd, np)
Enter spendings on who and what (nd, np)
Calculate percentages based off of this (nd, np)
Create monthly budget based off of savings (nd, np)

My programming "practices" are probably not industry standard, but this project is to test if I can take an idea from start to finish all while creating a modular program.
