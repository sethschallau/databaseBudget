# databaseBudget
Program for Budgeting:

Goal: The program will track income, spending, and provide percentages based on savings using this data.

Technologies: Python, MariaDB

How:

Install and setup mariaDB on the local system (not done, not in progress)

Create the database for the project (DONE)

Create tables to store this data: Savings, Spending, Total. These categories will be used to determine who and what money is being spent on. (DONE)

Allow user to create new tables for each category and person (DONE)

Enter enter income and how much will be saved (DONE)

Enter spendings on who and what (DONE)

Find the total amount remaining in my spending (nd, np)

Calculate percentages based off of the total and what/who money is spent on (nd, np)

Create monthly budget based off of savings (nd, np)

My programming "practices" are probably not industry standard, but this project is to test if I can take an idea from start to finish all while creating a modular program.


How will data be tracked and kept tidy:
	Spending will be sent individually to tables->columns that pertain to its category or person. The totals will be grabbed, both columns and tables, and then divided by each one individually. pretty basic math, I may do horribly in math but this is elementary :/
